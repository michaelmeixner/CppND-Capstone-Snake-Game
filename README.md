# CPPND: Capstone Snake Game

This repository includes my capstone project for the Udacity C++ Nanodegree Program. This project satisfies all criteria for the “README” and “Compiling and Testing” sections in the project rubric, and meets at least 5 additional criteria from the rest of the rubric. This project was based on the snake game skeleton provided by Udacity.

## My Changes/Additions:
* Added ability to end game via pressing the escape key (file: controller.cpp, line(s): 46-48).
* Added a thread lock (file: renderer.cpp, line(s): 95).
